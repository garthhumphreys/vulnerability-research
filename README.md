# Vulnerability Research Handbook

I decided to create this Handbook as resource that I wish I had when I first started to do Vulnerability Research. My hope is that if you're reading this and you too are like me, trying to discover how-to get started with Vulnerability Research that this Handbook will be a good guide to point you in the write direction and get you up to speed quickly.

Additionally, with all the hype around Bug Bounties, I sometimes feel it's easy to forget the point of participating in Cybersecurity, it's really about helping to identify security vulnerablities that present a risk to people and systems. Don't get me wrong, making money from your research and time is important and warranted, but there are so many other ways to help out and a lot of those ways involve less money or no money, but it can be just as statisying.

Ultimately, everyone has there own motivations and reasons for doing their paticular research, but for me I enjoy the technical challenge and the means by which to leave the world a little bit better, and safer than how I found it.
