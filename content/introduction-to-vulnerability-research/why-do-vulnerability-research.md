# Why do Vulnerability Research

Vulnerability Research is an important aspect of cybersecurity, as it helps to identify and mitigate security risks before they can be exploited by attackers. However, it is important to conduct vulnerability research ethically and responsibly, as improper disclosure of vulnerabilities could lead to harm for users and organizations. Therefore, vulnerability researchers often follow responsible disclosure guidelines, which involve notifying vendors and giving them time to patch the vulnerability before making it public.

Additionally, the research conducted by Vulnerability Researchers can help to educate developers, security professionals, and the broader public on best practices for secure software development and security testing.
