Hi,

My name is Garth Humphreys and I'm from the Cayman Islands. I've been pursing security research for awhile now and I like digging into source code and researching web applications.

In this book you'll find some useful links and resources I've found since beginning the journey of vulnerability research. Some of the information in this book may have been copied or referenced from other sources, however I've always tried to cite the sources of those references.

Thank you to all the people that share their security research and cybersecurity related information, your work is appreciated.
