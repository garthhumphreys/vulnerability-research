## Vulnerability Researchers {#my-anchor}

Vulnerability Researchers are security professionals, who typically use a variety of tools and techniques to discover vulnerabilities, including network and application scanners, reverse engineering tools, code analysis tools, and fuzzing tools.

Once a vulnerability is discovered, researchers may attempt to exploit it to demonstrate its impact and to provide proof-of-concept code to developers and vendors for patching.

## What is Vulnerability Research

Vulnerability research is the practice of identifying and analyzing security vulnerabilities in software, systems, and networks.

The purpose of vulnerability research is to find weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or disrupt operations.

> A Vulnerability by itself doesn't affect the product, software or system. It's only when an exploit is utilized does the prescence of a vulnerability become and issue.

## Why do Vulnerability Research

Vulnerability Research is an important aspect of cybersecurity, as it helps to identify and mitigate security risks before they can be exploited by attackers.

However, it is important to conduct vulnerability research ethically and responsibly, as improper disclosure of vulnerabilities could lead to harm for users and organizations.

Therefore, vulnerability researchers often follow responsible disclosure guidelines, which involve notifying vendors and giving them time to patch the vulnerability before making it public.

Additionally, the research conducted by Vulnerability Researchers can help to educate developers, security professionals, and the broader public on best practices for secure software development and security testing.
