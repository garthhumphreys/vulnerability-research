# Getting Started

Hi there! Here's how to get started in [Vulnerability Research](/introduction/what-is-vulnerability-research), but before we can dive into the details there are a few things to consider before starting your research. Making some of these decisions and setting goals for your research will help you stay focus and motivated, especially when you eventually hit a roadblock.

We want to:

1. Choose a System, Product, Protocol, or Algorithm
2. Decide if it will be open source
3. How popular the System, Product, Protocol, or Algorithm

## Types of System/Product to Research

1. Desktop Applications
   1. Reverse Engineering
   2. Binary Tools
2. Web Applications
   1. Remote Debugging
   2. DAST Tools
3. Mobile Applications
   1. Reverse Engineering
   2. Binary Tools

## Open Source vs Closed Source to Research

- Pros
- Cons

Source code audit
