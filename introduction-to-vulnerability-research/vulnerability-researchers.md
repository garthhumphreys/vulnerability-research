# Vulnerability Researchers

Vulnerability Researchers are security professionals, who typically use a variety of tools and techniques to discover vulnerabilities, including network and application scanners, reverse engineering tools, code analysis tools, and fuzzing tools. Once a vulnerability is discovered, researchers may attempt to exploit it to demonstrate its impact and to provide proof-of-concept code to developers and vendors for patching.
