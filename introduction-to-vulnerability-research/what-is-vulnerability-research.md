# What is Vulnerability Research

Vulnerability research is the practice of identifying and analyzing security vulnerabilities in software, systems, and networks. The purpose of vulnerability research is to find weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or disrupt operations.

> A Vulnerability by itself doesn't affect the product, software or system. It's only when an exploit is utilized does the prescence of a vulnerability become and issue.
